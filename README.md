PURPOSE
=======

This lab will introduce you to the practice of analyzing, segmenting, feature extracting, and applying basic classifications to audio files. Our future labs will build upon this essential work - but will use more sophisticated training sets, features, and classifiers.

We'll first need to setup some additional Matlab folders, toolboxes, and scripts that we'll use later.

DIRECTORY
=========

Go to the folder: /usr/ccrma/courses/mir2013

1. Launch Matlab
2. Configure your Path: Add the folder /usr/ccrma/courses/mir2013/
Toolboxes
to your local Matlab path
(including all subfolders).
3. Set the "Java Heap Memory" to 900 MB via : File>Preferences>General> Java Heap Memory
This allows us to load large audio files and feature vectors into memory.
Click on "OK"
Click Apply.
4. Restart Matlab.
